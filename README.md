Professor Uhe 

IS445 -Data Visualization

Final Project

Biggest Takeaway from this class was that it taught me the basic visualization tools and also how the lesson can help me with other classes that involves data visualization. Before coming to this class, I had a lot of python classes such as STATS 107 and 207. But this class helped me to focus on the details and also picking out characteristics of each data visualization. I believe I could benefit from this class in a lot of ways by the lesson videos the professor provided me. I believe I have been exposed to a sufficient amount of concepts and have acquired a lexicon of representational and visual concepts. I think I could use all the things I learnt from this class to other classes that are good for my data science classes.

Things Professor Uhe could improve on as a teacher: 
I don't think of many things since Professor Uhe was very communicative and also the classes were very easy to understand. If I had to point out a thing, I would say it would be to have more time in class and making the students interact more in class. I would also suggest on incorporating guest lectures from industry professionals who use data visualization in their roles and having more materials or even maybe a workshop. OVerall, I enjoyed the class a lot and enjoyed doing the data visualizations every week and the other assignments that was given by the instructor. It helped me to know a lot about the subject and use those skill in real life.
